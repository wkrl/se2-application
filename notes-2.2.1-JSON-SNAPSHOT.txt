Notes-2.2.1-JSON-SNAPSHOT.txt

The code in Version 2.2.1-JSON-SNAPSHOT is unfortunately broke and will not
build because various JSON-related imports cannot be resolved including:

import com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonParseException;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonIgnore;

In order to fix the problem, the Jackson-package that is used in the code base
for JSON processing needs to be installed.

Three packages are needed:
 - jackson core, databind and annotations

Go to the central repository and search for these packages using as search
string: "jackson core databind annotations".

Use version 2.9.8 for all three packages.

Build and run the code base and verify that .json-Files have been created
in the ./data directory.

Inspect those .json-Files.

Update the version to 2.2.2-JSON-SNAPSHOT such that
  mvn package

will produce in target
  se2-application-2.2.2-JSON-SNAPSHOT.jar

Check changes of the now fixed code base 2.2.2-JSON into your repository.
